    A final project for Pavement Mantainence and Rehabilitation, using the World Bank's opensource software [RoadLabPro](https://github.com/WorldBank-Transport/RoadLab-Pro). The idea is to leverage distributed measurments of roughness with cellphone accelerometer data for small municipal mantainence scheduling. More info [here](https://github.com/JPchomp/roughness).
