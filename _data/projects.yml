    Although most reliability analysis for networks uses concepts from graph theory to assess reliability, these metrics fall short when informing investment decisions on practical quantities. Alternatively, flow metrics are used but require assumptions on the flow mechanics and become difficult to analyze probabilistically in reasonable computational time. This work aims to condense all these aspects relevant to practical network infrastructure resilience in a single approach. More info [here](https://github.com/JPchomp/resilience).

    This was the capstone project for the professional engineering degree at the University of Buenos Aires. Includes the detail calculations and drawings for the provision of potable water, sanitation and storm sewers for the city of San Antonio de Areco.

- name: Latin American and Caribbean Household Travel Surveys Analysis
  #link: github.com/JPchomp
  github: JPchomp/LAC-Household-Travel-Surveys-Report
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Main results from the consolidated household travel surveys of Bogota, Montevideo, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Santiago and Buenos Aires. Within the analyses there is a general overview of the variables considered and information on the surveys geographic coverage. Sample equity analyses and main flows by mode are produced and normalized by city volumes. More info [here](https://jpchomp.github.io/LAC-Household-Travel-Surveys-Report/).

- name: Road roughness measurment with mobile devices

  github: JPchomp/roughness
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Final project for Pavement Mantainence and Rehabilitation. Using the World Bank's opensource software [RoadLabPro](https://github.com/WorldBank-Transport/RoadLab-Pro) we sought to leverage distributed measurments of roughness with cellphone accelerometer data using machine learning techniques. This could be used for structural health monitoring and predictive mantainance by municipal agencies. More info [here](https://github.com/JPchomp/roughness).
